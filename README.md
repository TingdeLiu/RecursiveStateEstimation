# Recursive State Estimation for Dynamic Systems

## üìç Overview

This repository contains a complete MATLAB implementation for comparing different state estimation methods used in tracking the 2D position and velocity of an autonomous vehicle on a racetrack. The methods include various Kalman filters and particle filtering techniques.

The dataset and task were provided as part of the course *Recursive State Estimation for Dynamic Systems* at the Geod√§tisches Institut, Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover (SoSe 2024).

## üöó Scenario
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be103192-2a45-464f-bdc1-49b7eb97776c)

An autonomous test vehicle moves along a predefined racetrack, tracked by two total stations (TS1 & TS2). Each station provides:
- Distance `d_TSi(k)` and
- Horizontal angle `Œ±_TSi(k)` at each time step `k`.

A section of the track has a known constant curve radius `R = 9.00 m`. This geometrical constraint is used in some of the filtering approaches.

## üì¶ State and Observation Models

### üîß State vector `x(k)`:
```
x(k) = [x(k), y(k), v_x(k), v_y(k)]·µÄ
```
2D position and velocity in meters and m/s.

### üì° Observation vector `l(k)`:
```
l(k) = [d_TS1(k), Œ±_TS1(k), d_TS2(k), Œ±_TS2(k)]
```

Known parameters:
- TS1 position: [135.54 m, 98.79 m]
- TS2 position: [110.00 m, 90.00 m]

## üìê Implemented Filters

- [x] Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- [x] EKF with known curve constraint
- [x] Iterated EKF (IEKF)
- [x] Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- [x] Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
- [x] Particle Filter (PF)

Each filter is modularly implemented in separate MATLAB functions.

## üìä Tasks

- Build system and measurement models (`ffun.m` and `hfun.m`)
- Implement multiple filters (`filter_*.m`)
- Perform RMSE-based comparison over time
- Conduct Monte Carlo simulations for parameter sensitivity:
  - Iterations (IEKF)
  - Samples (EnKF)
  - Particles (PF)
- Analyze effect of sampling rate and noise parameters

## üõ† Notes

- Use `atan2()` for angle computation to ensure correct quadrant detection.
- Pay attention to unit conversions (e.g., mm vs m, gon vs rad).
- Compare filter output with ground truth for plausibility.
- Use symbolic differentiation (e.g. WolframAlpha) for Jacobians in EKF.
